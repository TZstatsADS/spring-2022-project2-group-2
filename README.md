+ **Project summary**:In this project, we use the data from [NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc) and [NYPD Arrests Data (Historic)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u). We want to illustrate the relationships among *time period, location, race, sex, and criminal type* with *number of crimes*. We used three materials to visualize our dataset:
	+  "Map" shows *the density of crimes* among *different areas* occured in New York City. "Precinct" and "Borough" can be selected so that users can choose which kind of map they prefer to see. Furthermore, users can also to see the number of crime in specified area by pointing that area.
	+  In "Bar", users can select at least one race and one sex to visualize the the relationships between *race & sex* and *crime numbers* within the past 4 years though a bar graph. 
	+  Via "Series", users can see a line chart with different *criminal types*, as *time period per quater* versus either *the counts of crime* or *the percentage of crime*.
