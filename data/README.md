# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### Data folder

The original data is downloaded from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc and https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u.
These two data sets are too large to be pushed online. Thus, we just uploaded the cleaned data set "arrest.csv".
